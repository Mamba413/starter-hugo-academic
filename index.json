Laser marks are the scars left after panretinal photocoagulation, a treatment to prevent patients with severe DR from losing vision. In this study, we develop a deep learning algorithm based on the lightweight U-Net to segment laser marks from the color fundus photos, which could help indicate a stage or providing valuable auxiliary information for the care of DR patients. We prepared our training and testing data, manually annotated by trained and experienced graders from Image Reading Center, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, publicly available to fill the vacancy of public image datasets dedicated to the segmentation of laser marks. The lightweight U-Net, along with two postprocessing procedures, achieved an AUC of 0.9824, an optimal sensitivity of 94.16%, and an optimal specificity of 92.82% on the segmentation of laser marks in fundus photographs. With accurate segmentation and high numeric metrics, the lightweight U-Net method showed its reliable performance in automatically segmenting laser marks in fundus photographs, which could help the AI assist the diagnosis of DR in the severe stage.","tags":[],"title":"Segmentation of Laser Marks of Diabetic Retinopathy in the Fundus Photographs Using Lightweight U-Net","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jin Zhu","Liyuan Hu","Junhao Huang","Kangkang Jiang","Yanhang Zhang","Shiyun Lin","Junxian Zhu","Xueqin Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644252180,"objectID":"c6fb6fe39caa6e9b69b7e9c9095f16f8","permalink":"https://mamba413.github.io/publication/zhu-abess-fast-best-2021/","publishdate":"2022-02-07T16:43:00.837453Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhu-abess-fast-best-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"abess: A Fast Best Subset Selection Library in Python and R","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jin Zhu","Wenliang Pan","Wei Zheng","Xueqin Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644251907,"objectID":"23dae2abab6bd5aea3618856fe1a5600","permalink":"https://mamba413.github.io/publication/ball-2021-zhu/","publishdate":"2022-02-07T16:38:27.052801Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ball-2021-zhu/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Ball: An R package for detecting distribution difference and association in metric spaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yanhang Zhang","Junxian Zhu","Jin Zhu","Xueqin Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644252180,"objectID":"33fe72427ab88a226b6ce2476b9d235c","permalink":"https://mamba413.github.io/publication/zhang-certifiably-polynomial-algorithm-2021/","publishdate":"2022-02-07T16:43:00.748118Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang-certifiably-polynomial-algorithm-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Certifiably Polynomial Algorithm for Best Group Subset Selection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xueqin Wang","Jin Zhu","Wenliang Pan","Junhao Zhu","Heping Zhang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644252180,"objectID":"7884737eb732aafaf6d0bff1e38373e2","permalink":"https://mamba413.github.io/publication/wang-nonparametric-statistical-inference-2021/","publishdate":"2022-02-07T16:43:00.601499Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-nonparametric-statistical-inference-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Nonparametric Statistical Inference via Metric Distribution Function in Metric Spaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["JunXian Zhu","CanHong Wen","Jin Zhu","XueQin Wang","HePing Zhang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644251907,"objectID":"7f85dc7cda00e61793c123a49cc2ff56","permalink":"https://mamba413.github.io/publication/zhu-2020-splicing/","publishdate":"2022-02-07T16:38:27.496565Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhu-2020-splicing/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A polynomial algorithm for best subset selection problem","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wenliang Pan","Xueqin Wang","Heping Zhang","Hongtu Zhu","Jin Zhu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644251907,"objectID":"caae466c20d7c9ed47a1bfa96683bcba","permalink":"https://mamba413.github.io/publication/pan-2020-ball/","publishdate":"2022-02-07T16:38:27.404627Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pan-2020-ball/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Ball covariance: A generic measure of dependence in banach space","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jin Zhu","Kunsheng Lv","Aijun Zhang","Wenliang Pan","Xueqin Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644251907,"objectID":"963475a0ca4a3b5e30ef3d56c39f2ed7","permalink":"https://mamba413.github.io/publication/zhu-twosample-test-compositional-2019/","publishdate":"2022-02-07T16:38:27.587699Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhu-twosample-test-compositional-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Two-sample test for compositional data with ball divergence","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://mamba413.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
