abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) aims to estimate the return of a target policy
  using some pre-collected observational data generated by a potentially different
  behavior policy. In many cases, there exist unmeasured variables that confound the
  action-reward or action-next-state relationships, rendering many existing OPE approaches
  ineffective. This paper develops an instrumental variable (IV)-based method for
  consistent OPE in confounded sequential decision making. Similar to single-stage
  decision making, we show that IV enables us to correctly identify the target policy's
  value in infinite horizon settings as well. Furthermore, we propose a number of
  policy value estimators and illustrate their effectiveness through extensive simulations
  and real data analysis from a world-leading short-video platform.
